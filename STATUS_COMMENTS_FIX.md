# Status Comments Visibility Fix

## Issue
Customers were unable to see consultant comments when status changes were made to support tickets.

## Root Cause Analysis
The application had proper UI components and database structure for displaying status change comments, but there was a critical bug in the service layer:

1. **UI Layer**: ✅ StatusHistory component properly displayed comments from status change logs
2. **API Layer**: ✅ StatusController had GetStatusHistory endpoint that returned comments
3. **Database Layer**: ✅ StatusChangeLogs table was properly structured with Comment field
4. **Service Layer**: ❌ **BUG FOUND**: `UpdateStatusAsync` method was only updating the Order table but not creating StatusChangeLog entries

## Problem Details
In `SupportRequestService.cs`, the `UpdateStatusAsync` method was:
- Updating the Order.StatusString field ✅
- Updating the Order.StatusId field ✅  
- **Missing**: Creating StatusChangeLog entries ❌

This meant that when consultants updated ticket status with comments, the comments were never persisted to the database, so the StatusHistory component had no data to display to customers.

## Fix Implementation

### 1. Updated SupportRequestService.cs
- **Modified method signature**: Added `changedByUserId` parameter to track who made the status change
- **Added StatusChangeLog creation**: Now creates log entries with comments, timestamps, and user information
- **Proper status mapping**: Gets StatusMaster records for both old and new status for foreign key relationships

```csharp
// Before - only updated Order table
public async Task<bool> UpdateStatusAsync(Guid orderId, string status, string? comment = null)

// After - creates StatusChangeLog entries
public async Task<bool> UpdateStatusAsync(Guid orderId, string status, Guid changedByUserId, string? comment = null)
```

### 2. Updated ISupportRequestService.cs
- Updated interface signature to match implementation

### 3. Updated SupportRequestsController.cs
- Modified controller to pass the authenticated user's ID to the service method
- Now properly tracks who made the status change

### 4. Enhanced StatusController.cs
- **Added security validation**: Customers can now only view status history for their own tickets
- **Added authorization check**: Validates ticket ownership before returning status history
- **Added proper using statements**: For ClaimTypes and security validation

## Security Enhancement
Added customer access control to the `GetStatusHistory` endpoint:
- Customers can only view status history for tickets they created
- Consultants and Admins can view any ticket's status history
- Prevents unauthorized access to other customers' ticket information

## Technical Changes Summary

### Files Modified:
1. `backend/Services/SupportRequestService.cs`
   - Added StatusChangeLog creation logic
   - Updated method signature

2. `backend/Services/ISupportRequestService.cs`
   - Updated interface method signature

3. `backend/Controllers/SupportRequestsController.cs`
   - Pass userId to UpdateStatusAsync method

4. `backend/Controllers/StatusController.cs`
   - Added customer authorization validation
   - Added System.Security.Claims using statement

### Database Impact:
- StatusChangeLogs table will now receive entries when status changes occur
- Comments are properly persisted with timestamp and user information
- No schema changes needed - existing table structure was correct

## Verification Steps
1. ✅ Backend builds successfully without errors
2. ⚙️ Next: Test status update with comments (consultant perspective)
3. ⚙️ Next: Verify customers can see the comments in status history
4. ⚙️ Next: Verify customers cannot see other customers' ticket history

## Impact
- **Customers**: Can now see consultant comments on status changes
- **Consultants**: Comments are properly saved and visible to customers
- **Security**: Improved data access control
- **Audit Trail**: Full status change history with user tracking

## Best Practices Implemented
- Proper user authentication and authorization
- Complete audit trail for status changes
- Secure data access patterns
- Clean separation of concerns between UI, API, and service layers
